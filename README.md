# Thinkful-Capstone-Project-1

In this project, I analyzed data from imaginary company Lariat rent-a-car and came up with a tool and recommendations for them to improve their rental fleet to meet their annual revenue goals.

The Excel file includes an interactive tool where quantity of cars of any make/model could be changed to view the projected affect on profit.
